# Reverse String Word by Word

## Problem Description

You are given a string **A** of size **N**.

Return the string **A** after reversing the string **word by word**.

### Notes
- A sequence of non-space characters constitutes a word.
- The reversed string should **not contain leading or trailing spaces**, even if they are present in the input.
- If there are **multiple spaces between words**, reduce them to a **single space** in the output.

## Problem Constraints
- `1 <= N <= 3 * 10^5`
