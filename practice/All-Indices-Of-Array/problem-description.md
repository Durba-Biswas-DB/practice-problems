# All Indices Of Array

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers A with N elements and a target integer B, the task is to find all the indices at which B occurs in the array.

Note: The problem encourages recursive logic for learning purposes. Although the online judge doesn't enforce recursion, it's recommended to use recursive solutions to align with the question's spirit.

## Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^3  
1 <= A[i] <= 10^3  
1 <= B <= 10^3  

It is guaranteed that the target B exists at least once in the Array A.
