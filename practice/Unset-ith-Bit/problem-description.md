# Unset i-th Bit

## Problem Description

You are given two integers **A** and **B**.

- If the **B-th bit** in **A** is **set (1)**, make it **unset (0)**.
- If the **B-th bit** in **A** is already **unset (0)**, leave **A** unchanged.

Return the updated value of **A**.

---

## Notes

- Bit positions are **0-indexed**
- The **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** has index `0`

---

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= A <= 10^9`
- `0 <= B <= 30`
