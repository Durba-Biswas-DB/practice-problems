# Sum of All Submatrices

## Problem Description

Given a 2D matrix **A** of dimensions **N × N**, return the **sum of all possible submatrices** of the matrix.

A submatrix is defined as a contiguous rectangular block of the original matrix.

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= N <= 30`
- `0 <= A[i][j] <= 10`
