# Set Matrix Zeros

## Problem Description

You are given a 2D integer matrix **A**.  
If any cell `A[i][j]` is equal to **0**, you must set **its entire row `i` and entire column `j` to 0**.

Your task is to modify the matrix **in-place** and return the updated matrix.

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= A.size() <= 10^3`
- `1 <= A[i].size() <= 10^3`
- `0 <= A[i][j] <= 10^3`
