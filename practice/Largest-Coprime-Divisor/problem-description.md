# Largest Coprime Divisor

## Problem Description

You are given two positive numbers A and B. You need to find the maximum valued integer X such that:

- X divides A, i.e. `A % X = 0`
- X and B are co-prime, i.e. `gcd(X, B) = 1`

Return the maximum possible value of X.

## Problem Constraints

- 1 <= A, B <= 10⁹
