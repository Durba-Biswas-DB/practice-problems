# Spiral Order Matrix

## Problem Description

Given an integer **A**, generate a **square matrix of size A × A** filled with elements from **1 to A²** in **spiral order** and return the generated matrix.

The spiral order starts from the **top-left corner**, moves **right**, then **down**, **left**, and **up**, repeating this pattern until the matrix is completely filled.
