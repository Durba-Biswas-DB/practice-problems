# Merge Sorted Overlapping Intervals – 2

## Problem Description

You are given a collection of intervals **A** in a 2-D array format, where each interval is represented by a pair of integers `[start, end]`.  
The intervals are **sorted based on their start values**.

Your task is to **merge all overlapping intervals** and return the resulting set of **non-overlapping intervals**.

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= len(A) <= 100000`
- `1 <= A[i][0] <= A[i][1] <= 100000`
- The intervals are sorted based on `A[i][0]`
