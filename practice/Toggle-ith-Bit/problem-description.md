# Toggle i-th Bit

## Problem Description

You are given two integers **A** and **B**.

Your task is to **toggle the B-th bit** of the integer **A**:

- If the B-th bit in **A** is **set (1)**, make it **unset (0)**.
- If the B-th bit in **A** is **unset (0)**, make it **set (1)**.

Return the updated value of **A**.

> **Note:**  
> Bit positions are **0-indexed**, meaning the least significant bit (LSB) is at index `0`.

---

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= A <= 10^9`
- `0 <= B <= 30`
