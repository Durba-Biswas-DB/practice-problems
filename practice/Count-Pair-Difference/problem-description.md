# Count Pair Difference

## Problem Description

You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B.  
Count the number of pairs (i, j) such that A[i] - A[j] = B and i ≠ j.

Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count with 10^9 + 7.

## Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5  
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9  
1 <= B <= 10^9
