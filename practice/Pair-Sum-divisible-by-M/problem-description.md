# Pair Sum Divisible by M

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the number of pairs in A whose sum is divisible by B.

Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo (10⁹ + 7).

Note: Ensure to handle integer overflow when performing the calculations.

## Problem Constraints

- 1 <= length of the array <= 100000  
- 1 <= A[i] <= 10⁹  
- 1 <= B <= 10⁶
