# Longest Palindromic Substring

## Problem Description

You are given a string **A** of size **N**.  
Your task is to **find and return the longest palindromic substring** within the string.

A **substring** of string `A` is defined as `A[i...j]` where  
`0 <= i <= j < len(A)`.

### Palindrome Definition
A string is considered a **palindrome** if it reads the same forwards and backwards.  
Formally, a string `A` is a palindrome if: A == reverse(A)

---

### Additional Rule
If multiple palindromic substrings of the **same maximum length** exist, return the one that **appears first** (i.e., has the **smallest starting index**).

---

## Problem Constraints:
1 <= N <= 6000
