# Noble Integer

## Problem Description

Given an integer array **A**, determine whether there exists an integer **p** in the array such that:

> The number of integers **strictly greater than p** in the array is **equal to p**.

If such a number exists, return **1**.  
Otherwise, return **-1**.

This type of number is known as a **Noble Integer**.

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= |A| <= 2 * 10^5`
- `-10^8 <= A[i] <= 10^8`

---

## Approach

1. **Sort the array** — this allows easy counting of how many elements are greater than the current element by using its index.
2. Loop through the sorted array:
   - Skip duplicates because the count of greater elements will be the same for all duplicates.
   - For each index `i`, the number of elements greater than `A[i]` is:
     ```
     N - i - 1
     ```
   - If:
     ```
     A[i] == N - i - 1
     ```
     then `A[i]` is a **Noble Integer**, so return `1`.
3. If the loop completes with no match, return `-1`.

This approach works efficiently in **O(N log N)** due to sorting.
