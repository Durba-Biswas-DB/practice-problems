# Count Pair Sum

## Problem Description

You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B.  
Count the number of pairs (i, j) such that:

- A[i] + A[j] = B  
- i ≠ j  
- (i, j) is the same as (j, i), so count each pair only once  

Since the answer can be very large, return the count modulo **10⁹ + 7**.

## Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 10^5  
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9  
1 <= B <= 10^9
