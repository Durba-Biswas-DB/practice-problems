# Rain Water Trapped

## Problem Description

Imagine a histogram where the bars' heights are given by the array **A**.  
Each bar has a uniform width of **1 unit**. When it rains, water collects in the gaps between the bars.

Your task is to calculate the **total amount of water** that can be trapped between the bars after raining.

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= |A| <= 10^5`
- `0 <= A[i] <= 10^5`
