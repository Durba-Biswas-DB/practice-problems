# Number of 1 Bits

## Problem Description

Write a function that takes an integer **A** and returns the number of `1` bits present in its binary representation.

---

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= A <= 10^9`

---

## Key Idea (Optimized Approach)

Instead of checking every bit position one by one, we use **Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm**.
