# Next Permutation

## Problem Description

Implement the **next permutation**, which rearranges numbers into the numerically next greater permutation of numbers for a given array **A** of size **N**.

If such an arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged into the **lowest possible order**, i.e., sorted in ascending order.

### NOTE
- The replacement must be done **in-place**
- **Do not allocate extra memory**
- **Do NOT use library functions** for next permutation  
  (Using library functions will disqualify the submission)

---

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= N <= 5 * 10^5`
- `1 <= A[i] <= 10^9`
