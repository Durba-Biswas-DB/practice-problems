# Strange Equality

## Problem Description

Given an integer A.

Two numbers, X and Y, are defined as follows:

- X is the greatest number smaller than A such that the XOR sum of X and A is the same as the sum of X and A.
- Y is the smallest number greater than A such that the XOR sum of Y and A is the same as the sum of Y and A.

Find and return the XOR of X and Y.

**NOTE**
- XOR of X and Y is defined as X ^ Y where '^' is the BITWISE XOR operator.
- Your code will be run against a maximum of 100000 test cases.

## Constraints

- 1 <= A <= 10^9
