# Implement Power Function

Implement pow(A, B) % C.  
In other words, given A, B and C, Find (A^B % C).  
Note: The remainders on division cannot be negative. In other words, make sure the answer you return is non-negative.

## Problem Constraints

-10^9 <= A <= 10^9  
0 <= B <= 10^9  
1 <= C <= 10^9
