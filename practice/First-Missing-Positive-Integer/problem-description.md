# First Missing Positive Integer

## Problem Description

Given an unsorted integer array **A** of size **N**, find the **first missing positive integer**.

A positive integer is defined as any integer greater than `0`.

### Note
- Your algorithm should run in **O(N)** time.
- You must use **constant extra space**.

## Problem Constraints

- `1 <= N <= 1,000,000`
- `-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9`
